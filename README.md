### PBL OS PROJECT

## 📌 Overview  
Virtual Memory Manager is an interactive educational platform that visualizes memory management algorithms through simulations, comparisons, and quizzes. Designed to help students understand virtual memory concepts with hands-on experimentation.

## 🔗 Live Demo  
👉 [https://virtual-memory-sim.vercel.app/](https://virtual-memory-sim.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Features  
- *Algorithm Simulations*: Interactive visualization of FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Clock, and other page replacement algorithms  
- *Performance Comparison*: Side-by-side metrics comparison across different algorithms  
- *Educational Resources*: Detailed explanations of memory management concepts  
- *Interactive Quiz*: Knowledge assessment with instant feedback  
- *Customizable Parameters*: Adjust frame counts, reference strings, and simulation speed  
- *Real-time Visualization*: Animated memory state changes during simulations  
- *TLB Simulation*: Optional Translation Lookaside Buffer implementation  

## 🏗 Tech Stack  
- *Frontend*: Next.js, React  
- *Styling*: Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI  
- *Visualization*: Recharts, SVG animations  
- *State Management*: React Context API  
- *Deployment*: Vercel  

## 📜 Problem Statement  
*Bridging the Gap in Memory Management Education*  
Computer science students often struggle to grasp virtual memory concepts through static diagrams. This tool provides dynamic, interactive visualizations to make these abstract concepts tangible and understandable.

## 🎯 Solution Approach  
- *Interactive Simulations*: Visualize algorithms in action with adjustable parameters  
- *Comparative Analysis*: Highlight performance differences between algorithms  
- *Gamified Learning*: Quiz system reinforces concepts through practice  
- *Responsive Design*: Accessible on all device sizes  

## 🔥 What Makes This Unique?  
✅ *Hands-on Learning* - Experiment with different algorithms in real-time  
✅ *Comprehensive Comparisons* - Visualize tradeoffs between approaches  
✅ *Academic Focus* - Designed specifically for computer science education  
✅ *Open Source* - Adaptable for different curricula and teaching styles

### PBL OS PROJECT

## 📌 Overview  
Virtual Memory Manager is an interactive educational platform that visualizes memory management algorithms through simulations, comparisons, and quizzes. Designed to help students understand virtual memory concepts with hands-on experimentation.

## 🔗 Live Demo  
👉 [https://virtual-memory-sim.vercel.app/](https://virtual-memory-sim.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Features  
- *Algorithm Simulations*: Interactive visualization of FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Clock, and other page replacement algorithms  
- *Performance Comparison*: Side-by-side metrics comparison across different algorithms  
- *Educational Resources*: Detailed explanations of memory management concepts  
- *Interactive Quiz*: Knowledge assessment with instant feedback  
- *Customizable Parameters*: Adjust frame counts, reference strings, and simulation speed  
- *Real-time Visualization*: Animated memory state changes during simulations  
- *TLB Simulation*: Optional Translation Lookaside Buffer implementation  

## 🏗 Tech Stack  
- *Frontend*: Next.js, React  
- *Styling*: Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI  
- *Visualization*: Recharts, SVG animations  
- *State Management*: React Context API  
- *Deployment*: Vercel  

## 📜 Problem Statement  
*Bridging the Gap in Memory Management Education*  
Computer science students often struggle to grasp virtual memory concepts through static diagrams. This tool provides dynamic, interactive visualizations to make these abstract concepts tangible and understandable.

## 🎯 Solution Approach  
- *Interactive Simulations*: Visualize algorithms in action with adjustable parameters  
- *Comparative Analysis*: Highlight performance differences between algorithms  
- *Gamified Learning*: Quiz system reinforces concepts through practice  
- *Responsive Design*: Accessible on all device sizes  

## 🔥 What Makes This Unique?  
✅ *Hands-on Learning* - Experiment with different algorithms in real-time  
✅ *Comprehensive Comparisons* - Visualize tradeoffs between approaches  
✅ *Academic Focus* - Designed specifically for computer science education  
✅ *Open Source* - Adaptable for different curricula and teaching styles
